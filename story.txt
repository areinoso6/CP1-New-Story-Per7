I woke up today
I washed my face
I picked out my outfit
I prepared the pan with olive oil and turned on the heat
I put the toast in the toaster
I cracked 2 eggs open onto the pan
I cooked the eggs
I put the toast and eggs on a plate
I ate eggs and toast for breakfast
I got ready
I got on the bus
I went to school
I did a lab
School ended and I went to chop suey
I came back home on the bus
I did homework
I got ready for bed
I went to sleep
